      "whatIs": {
        "question": "What is Niko Sun?",
        "answer": "Niko Sun is a decentralized platform that allows you to invest in solar energy projects through blockchain tokens. Each token represents a stake in a real solar project, and investors receive benefits proportional to the energy generated by the project."
      },
      "howToInvest": {
        "question": "How can I invest in a project?",
        "answer": "To invest, first connect your compatible wallet (such as MetaMask) and make sure you're on the Syscoin Testnet network. Then, explore the available projects on the main page, select the number of tokens you want to buy (respecting the minimum purchase), and confirm the transaction. The tokens will be automatically credited to your wallet."
      },
      "whatAreTokens": {
        "question": "What do the tokens I buy represent?",
        "answer": "Each token represents a proportional stake in a solar project. Tokens follow the ERC-1155 standard, which means you can own multiple tokens from different projects. Your stake determines the percentage of energy revenue you can claim."
      },
      "howRewards": {
        "question": "How do rewards work?",
        "answer": "When a project generates energy and the administrator deposits revenue, it is distributed proportionally among all token holders. Your reward is calculated based on the number of tokens you own relative to the total tokens sold for the project."
      },
      "claimRewards": {
        "question": "How do I claim my rewards?",
        "answer": "You can claim your rewards in two ways: 1) From the project card, by clicking 'Claim' when you have available rewards. 2) From your Portfolio (My Portfolio), where you can see all your investments and claim all rewards at once with the 'Claim All' button."
      },
      "security": {
        "question": "Is it safe to invest on the platform?",
        "answer": "The smart contract is built with OpenZeppelin security standards, including reentrancy protection, emergency pause system, and role-based access control. All transactions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain."
      }
    },
    "admin": {
      "createProject": {
        "question": "How do I create a new solar project?",
        "answer": "Go to the Administration Panel and select the 'Create Project' tab. Fill in the fields: project name, total token supply, price per token (in tSYS), and minimum purchase. When you confirm the transaction, the project will be created and you will be registered as its creator."
      },
      "manageProject": {
        "question": "What can I do as a project creator?",
        "answer": "As a creator you can: 1) Activate or deactivate the project (purchases are only allowed on active projects). 2) Update the generated energy (kWh). 3) Deposit revenue to distribute among investors. 4) Withdraw the token sales balance. 5) Transfer project ownership to another address."
      },
      "depositRevenue": {
        "question": "How do I deposit revenue for my investors?",
        "answer": "In the Administration Panel, go to the 'Revenue' tab. Select your project, enter the amount in tSYS you want to distribute, and optionally the energy generated in kWh. Upon confirmation, the revenue will be distributed proportionally and investors will be able to claim it."
      },
      "withdrawSales": {
        "question": "How do I withdraw money from token sales?",
        "answer": "In the 'Revenue' tab of the Administration Panel, you will find the 'Withdraw Sales' section. You will see your project's available balance. Enter the recipient address and the amount to withdraw. Only the project creator can perform this operation."
      },
      "updateEnergy": {
        "question": "Why should I update the generated energy?",
        "answer": "Updating the generated energy (in kWh) allows investors to see the actual performance of the solar project. This metric is important for transparency and trust. You can update it from the 'Manage Project' tab by entering the additional kWh generated."
      },
      "permissions": {
        "question": "What are the different roles and permissions?",
        "answer": "There are three levels: 1) Normal user: can buy tokens and claim rewards. 2) Project creator: has full control over their projects (management, revenue, withdrawals). 3) Contract owner: can pause/resume the entire contract and create projects on behalf of other users."
      },
      "transferOwnership": {
        "question": "Can I transfer ownership of my project?",
        "answer": "Yes, as a creator you can transfer ownership of your project to another address. Go to 'Manage Project', select your project, and in the 'Transfer Ownership' section enter the new address. Once the transaction is confirmed, the new owner will have full control of the project."
